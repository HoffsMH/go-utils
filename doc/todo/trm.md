rm command that encrypts the specified directory
and packages with it a posix script that will restore the file even if trm is
not installed

- If a file in the same location is trmed twice then both are deleted, the
  encrypted file maybe uses hash?

- also prunes old files first and allows you to specify how large you are
  willing to let trash be
