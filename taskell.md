## To Do

- isabsolute to accomodate paths that begin with ~
- go through list of files and all single line links become two lines with the html title as the line after it
- binlist migrated in
- bulksearch migrated in
- alternate file to be split in so that its easy to add new notes from phone
- rm program that encrypts and provides native restoration
- rm program that automatically prunes oldest data first and also a limit on the total size of the trash bin
- time series data aggregation on system resources, so I can see what is eating up all my cpu, hopefully can hook it up to grafan
