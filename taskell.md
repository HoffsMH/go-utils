## To Do

- alternate file to be split in so that its easy to add new notes from phone
- rm program that encrypts and provides native restoration
- rm program that automatically prunes oldest data first and also a limit on the total size of the trash bin
- time series data aggregation on system resources, so I can see what is eating up all my cpu, hopefully can hook it up to grafan
- revive linter integration
- argv
- go mod vendor
- go mod tidy
- go testify
- look for places where it would be good to log.Fatal
- delve debugger
- wrap brought in and usable in vim
- takes js object and goes to json
- moves files from location to location based on file trait such as size
- openai file convesation format file -> binary +options, and then json -> binary -> file
